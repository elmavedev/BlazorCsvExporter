- ✔️ Added automated **GitHub Actions** workflow to build and run tests on each push/PR  
- ✔️ Improved installation instructions to always use the **latest NuGet version**  
- ✔️ Initial **unit test project** for the CSV generation core  
- ✔️ Minor documentation and repo cleanup 

This release consolidates all fixes and ensures the package passes all NuGet.org health checks ✅✅✅

---

## 📦 Installation

### Using .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package BlazorCsvExporter
```

This command will always pull the latest stable version from NuGet.org.

### Using PackageReference

You can also install the package via the NuGet Package Manager UI in Visual Studio.  
Your `.csproj` file will receive an entry similar to the following:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="BlazorCsvExporter" Version="x.y.z" />
</ItemGroup>
```

> The exact version (`x.y.z`) will be managed by NuGet when using the CLI command above.

## 🔧 JavaScript Setup

`BlazorCsvExporter` requires a small JavaScript helper to handle file downloads.  
If you are using the **included demo project**, this script is already referenced.  

However, if you install the library **directly from NuGet** in your own Blazor app,  
you need to add the following line manually in your host page:

### 👉 For Blazor WebAssembly
Add this line in `wwwroot/index.html`, right before the Blazor script:

```html
<script src="_content/BlazorCsvExporter/csvDownloader.js"></script>
<script src="_framework/blazor.web.js"></script>
```

### 👉 For Blazor Server
Add this line in `Pages/_Host.cshtml` (or `_Layout.cshtml` if applicable), right before `blazor.server.js`:

```html
<script src="_content/BlazorCsvExporter/csvDownloader.js"></script>
<script src="_framework/blazor.server.js"></script>
```

This script defines the global object `window.BlazorCsvExporter`  
and the function `downloadFile(...)` used internally by the component.  
Without this reference, the export button will throw an error such as:

```
Could not find 'BlazorCsvExporter.downloadFile' ('BlazorCsvExporter' was undefined)
```

Once the script is included, the download feature should work correctly in any Blazor app.

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

Add this line to your `_Imports.razor` file:
```razor
@using BlazorCsvExporter
```

Then use the exporter component in any Blazor page:

```razor
@page "/csv-demo"

<h3>CSV Export Demo</h3>

<!-- Replace parameter names with your actual implementation -->
<CsvExporter
    Items="@people"
    FileName="people.csv"
    ShowPreview="true" />

@code {
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }

    private List<Person> people = new()
    {
        new Person { Name = "Alice", Age = 30, City = "Berlin" },
        new Person { Name = "Bob", Age = 25, City = "Augsburg" },
        new Person { Name = "Charlie", Age = 35, City = "Munich" }
    };
}
```
